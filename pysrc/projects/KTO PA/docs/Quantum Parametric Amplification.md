Amplification of quantum signals is important for readout in superconducting quantum processors. Currently the state of the art amplifier is known as the Josephson Travelling Wave Parametric Amplifier.

These amplifiers can be understood by understanding the complex Hamiltonians that is being described by the embedded capacitors, inductors and Josephson junctions in the circuit. 

$$ H_{int} = a^{\dagger}_{signal} a^{\dagger}_{signal} a_{drive} a_{drive} $$
By looking at this, we see that it converts a drive excitation to a signal excitation.
